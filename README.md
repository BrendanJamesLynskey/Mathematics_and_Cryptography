## Presentation 01: Finite Field Arithmetic

16 interactive slides covering:

**Theory** — Group → Ring → Field → Finite Field progression. GF(p) prime fields with GF(7) worked examples. GF(2ⁿ) binary extension fields with AES polynomial arithmetic.

**Standards** — Which fields are used in AES, AES-GCM, NIST P-256, Curve25519, Curve448, and SM2 — and the engineering reasons behind each choice.

**Hardware** — SoC/ASIC composite field decomposition, FPGA LUT and Canright S-box designs, Montgomery multiplication with four architecture variants (bit-serial through full-parallel systolic array).

**Code** — Complete SystemVerilog GF(2⁸) multiplier, parameterized modular add/subtract modules, Python GF(2⁸) and GF(p) classes with Fermat inverse.

**Performance** — Throughput comparison from 3.2 Gbps (OpenSSL) to 53 Gbps (45nm ASIC), with area/speed/side-channel trade-off analysis.

## Presentation 07: Post-Quantum Cryptography

21 interactive slides covering:

**The Quantum Threat** — Shor's algorithm breaking RSA/ECC/DH in polynomial time. Grover's quadratic speedup against symmetric ciphers. The "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attack model. CRQC timeline estimates and CNSA 2.0 mandates.

**Lattice Mathematics** — Interactive 2D lattice visualisation with Closest Vector Problem demo. SVP, CVP, SIVP, GapSVP hard problems. Learning With Errors (LWE): search vs. decision variants, worst-case to average-case reductions (Regev 2005). Ring-LWE and Module-LWE structured variants. Interactive noise parameter demo showing why error makes LWE hard.

**NIST PQC Standards (Aug 2024)** — FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA), FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA). Upcoming: FIPS 206 (FN-DSA/FALCON), HQC (code-based KEM backup). NIST IR 8547 deprecation timeline (2035).

**ML-KEM Deep Dive** — Module-LWE construction: K-PKE → Fujisaki-Okamoto transform → IND-CCA2. Full protocol flow diagram (Alice/Bob key exchange). NTT butterfly architecture and ℤ₃₃₂₉ arithmetic. Parameter sets: ML-KEM-512/-768/-1024 with key/ciphertext sizes.

**ML-DSA Deep Dive** — Fiat-Shamir with Aborts paradigm (Lyubashevsky). Module-LWE + Module-SIS security basis. Parameter sets and abort loop mechanics.

**SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+)** — Hypertree architecture: WOTS+ → XMSS → FORS layers. 12 parameter sets across SHA-2/SHAKE, small/fast modes. Conservative hash-only security assumptions.

**Interactive Comparisons** — Switchable bar charts comparing public key, secret key, and ciphertext/signature sizes across all PQC and classical algorithms. Performance benchmarks: ML-KEM vs. X25519 vs. RSA-2048; ML-DSA vs. Ed25519.

**Hardware Implementation** — NTT accelerator architecture for SoC/FPGA/ASIC. Barrett reduction in ℤ₃₃₂₉. Keccak/SHAKE co-processors. Cortex-M4, Artix-7, and 28nm ASIC benchmarks.

**Code** — Python NTT implementation in ℤ₃₃₂₉ with bit-reversed twiddle factors. Pedagogical ML-KEM key generation sketch with CBD sampling.

**Migration** — Hybrid TLS 1.3 key exchange (X25519 + ML-KEM-768). Three-phase migration roadmap. Crypto-agility design principles. Algorithm decision matrix.
